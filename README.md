## Prototype Development for Image Captioning Using the BLIP Model and Gradio Framework

### AIM:
To design and deploy a prototype application for image captioning by utilizing the **BLIP image-captioning model** and integrating it with the **Gradio UI framework** for user interaction and evaluation.

### PROBLEM STATEMENT:
The challenge is to create an interactive image captioning tool that uses a pretrained BLIP model to generate captions for images uploaded by users. The application should be able to receive an image, pass it through the BLIP model to generate captions, and then display the generated caption to the user in a user-friendly Gradio interface.

### DESIGN STEPS:

#### STEP 1: Set up the environment
- Install required libraries like **Gradio** and **BLIP**.
- Ensure the environment has access to the necessary model files.

#### STEP 2: Load the BLIP Model
- Load the BLIP model from a pretrained version available through libraries like `transformers` or another source.
- Ensure that the BLIP model is correctly configured to accept image inputs and generate captions.

#### STEP 3: Build the Gradio Interface
- Define a simple UI using **Gradio**, where users can upload an image.
- The Gradio interface will display the caption generated by the BLIP model after processing the image.

#### STEP 4: Testing and Evaluation
- Run the application and evaluate its performance by testing it with a variety of images.
- Verify if the captions generated are relevant, accurate, and provide useful descriptions of the images.

```py

from PIL import Image
import base64 
from dotenv import load_dotenv, find_dotenv
_ = load_dotenv(find_dotenv())  # read local .env file

hf_api_key = os.environ['HF_API_KEY']

# Helper functions
import requests, json

# Image-to-text endpoint
def get_completion(inputs, parameters=None, ENDPOINT_URL=os.environ['HF_API_ITT_BASE']):
    headers = {
        "Authorization": f"Bearer {hf_api_key}",
        "Content-Type": "application/json"
    }
    data = { "inputs": inputs }
    if parameters is not None:
        data.update({"parameters": parameters})
    response = requests.request("POST",
                                ENDPOINT_URL,
                                headers=headers,
                                data=json.dumps(data))
    return json.loads(response.content.decode("utf-8"))

# TESTING WITH A DIRECT IMAGE URL
image_url = "https://free-images.com/or/5549/wesley_sneijder_vs_lionel.jpg"
display(IPython.display.Image(url=image_url))
get_completion(image_url)

# Gradio Integration
import gradio as gr 

def image_to_base64_str(pil_image):
    byte_arr = io.BytesIO()
    pil_image.save(byte_arr, format='PNG')
    byte_arr = byte_arr.getvalue()
    return str(base64.b64encode(byte_arr).decode('utf-8'))

def captioner(image):
    base64_image = image_to_base64_str(image)
    result = get_completion(base64_image)
    return result[0]['generated_text']

gr.close_all()
demo = gr.Interface(fn=captioner,
                    inputs=[gr.Image(label="Upload image", type="pil")],
                    outputs=[gr.Textbox(label="Caption")],
                    title="Image Captioning with BLIP",
                    description="Caption any image using the BLIP model",
                    allow_flagging="never",
                    examples=["christmas_dog.jpeg", "bird_flight.jpeg", "cow.jpeg"])

### RESULT:
Thus, The application allows users to upload an image through the Gradio interface, where it is processed by the BLIP model to generate a caption. Once the image is processed, the BLIP model produces a concise and relevant description of the image, which is displayed back to the user. For instance, if the uploaded image depicts a dog running in a park, the model may generate a caption such as "A dog running on grass." The system successfully demonstrates the integration of the BLIP image captioning model with Gradio, providing an intuitive and responsive user interface for real-time caption generation. The prototype works effectively for a variety of images, offering accurate and contextually appropriate captions. This application could be expanded further to handle more complex use cases, such as captioning images from specific domains like medical, fashion, or sports.
